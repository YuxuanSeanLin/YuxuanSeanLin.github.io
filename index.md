## Research Projects
* M.Phil project: sediment biogeochemistry

* **<u>Leader</u>**, University Undergraduate Innovation Training Program 
  + **<u>Purpose:</u>** Basing the Jiulong River Estuary and Xiamen Bay sediments in dry season, GC×GC-TOFMS technology is applied for high-throughput separation and selection, and relevant geochemical biomarkers data indicating geological features are obtained. As a result, we can acquire useful information about its origin and geological evolution, and then explore the geochemical trajectory, providing theoretical support for regional geochemical research and risk assessment.
  + **<u>Process:</u>** Relying on the sedimental samples required by shared cruise (JREB20181129) for the Jiulong River Estuary and Xiamen Bay, we separate the complex organic components by GC×GC-TOFMS, and take the qualitative and quantitative analysis of biomarkers (e.g. n-alkanes, aromatics, hopanes, steranes) in the sediments. Further, we calculate geochemical parameters basing on quantitative results. Finally, combined with hydrological conditions, we identify the sedimentary environment and geochemical trajectory through comparing the regional differences.

* **<u>Leader</u>**, ‘Lingfeng’ International Summer Research Program
  + **<u>Purpose:</u>** Understanding the size distribution of nitrate and its isotopic ratios in Xiamen University; investigating the different reaction mechanism taking place between HNO3 and NH3, and between HNO3 and NaCl, which will provide reference basis for further relevant research.
  + **<u>Process:</u>** A MOUDI sampler was used to collect aerosols for water soluble ions and nitrate nitrogen isotope in Xiamen University during June 2019. The particle cascade stages were <0.25, 0.25-0.44, 0.44-1.0, 1.0-1.4, 1.4-2.5, 2.5-10, 10-16 μm. The concentrations of water-soluble ions were determined by ion chromatography (IC), and the isotope ratios of nitrate-nitrogen were measured using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS).
